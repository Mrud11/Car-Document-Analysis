# Car Manual Document Analysis

## About the Project
This project analyzes car manual documents (specifically for Hyundai Accent) using open-source large language models (LLMs) and GPT API integrations. It extracts text from PDF manuals, chunks and embeds the text, stores it in a vector database, and builds a question-answering system accessible via a terminal interface.

## Features
- Extracts text from multiple PDF documents  
- Splits extracted text into manageable chunks  
- Generates vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers (MiniLM)  
- Stores embeddings and chunks in ChromaDB vector database  
- Integrates GPT API (Groq or OpenAI) for natural language Q&A responses  
- Interactive question-answer chatbot runs directly in terminal/VS Code

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- PyPDF2 (PDF text extraction)  
- sentence-transformers (embedding generation)  
- ChromaDB (vector database)  
- Requests (API calls to GPT model)  
- Groq API or OpenAI API for GPT  
- VS Code for development and execution

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mrud11/Car-Document-Analysis.git
   cd Car-Document-Analysis

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv

  Windows
  .\venv\Scripts\activate

  Linux/macOS
  source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Place your Hyundai Accent car manual PDF files in a folder locally.

5. Update the `pdf_folder` path and your GPT API key in the main Python script.

## Usage
Run the main script to start the interactive Q&A chatbot:
python main.py


You will be prompted to enter questions related to the car manual. Type your question and get answers generated by the GPT model using the context from the manual.

Type `exit` or `quit` to end the session.
